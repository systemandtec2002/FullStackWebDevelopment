Q1) the usage of ternory operator with syntax


Syntax
The ternary operator is a shorthand way to write an if-else statement in JavaScript. Its syntax is:

JavaScript
condition ? expression1 : expression2
Use code with caution.

condition: An expression that evaluates to a boolean value (true or false).
expression1: The value to be returned if the condition is true.
expression2: The value to be returned if the condition is false.
How it works
The ternary operator evaluates the condition. If the condition is true, the value of expression1 is returned. Otherwise, the value of expression2 is returned.

Example
JavaScript
let age = 25;
let canVote = (age >= 18) ? "You can vote" : "You cannot vote";
console.log(canVote); // Output: You can vote
Use code with caution.

Common Use Cases
Assigning values to variables:
JavaScript
let result = (x > y) ? x : y;
Use code with caution.

Conditional rendering in JSX (React):
JavaScript
return (
  <div>
    {condition ? <p>True</p> : <p>False</p>}
  </div>
);
Use code with caution.

Inline conditional logic:
JavaScript
console.log(isEven(num) ? "Even" : "Odd");
Use code with caution.

Important Considerations
While the ternary operator can make code more concise, it's essential to use it judiciously. Overusing it can make code less readable.
For complex conditions or multiple expressions, an if-else statement might be more appropriate.
