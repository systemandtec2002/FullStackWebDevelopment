Question 1: Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.


JavaScript: The Heartbeat of Web Development
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that's primarily used to create interactive web pages. It's one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.


Role in Web Development
While HTML structures the content of a webpage and CSS styles its appearance, JavaScript brings it to life. It's responsible for the dynamic and interactive elements you see on websites, such as:



User interactions: Handling clicks, hovers, form submissions, and other user actions.
Dynamic content updates: Loading new content without reloading the entire page (e.g., social media feeds, search results).
Animations and effects: Creating engaging visual experiences.
Game development: Building interactive games within web browsers.
Server-side development (Node.js): Creating web applications and APIs.
Mobile app development: Building cross-platform mobile apps using frameworks like React Native.
