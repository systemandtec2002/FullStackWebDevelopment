Q1) Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.


Conditional Statements
Conditional statements are programming constructs that allow a program to make decisions based on whether certain conditions are true or false. They control the flow of execution, determining which code blocks are executed and which are skipped.

Syntax
The basic structure of a conditional statement involves an if keyword followed by a condition in parentheses. If the condition evaluates to true, the code block within the if statement is executed. Otherwise, the code block is skipped.

JavaScript
if (condition) {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}

Examples =


1)let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
}

2) let age = 16;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor.");
}



if...else if...else statement:
Allows for multiple conditions to be checked sequentially. The first condition that evaluates to true will execute its corresponding code block. If no conditions are true, the else block is executed.
JavaScript
let grade = 90;

3) if (grade >= 90) {
  console.log("Excellent");
} else if (grade >= 80) {
  console.log("Good");
} else if (grade >= 70) {
  console.log("Average");
} else {
  console.log("Needs improvement");
}



let temperature = 25;

if (temperature > 30) {
  console.log("It's hot!");
} else if (temperature < 10) {
  console.log("It's cold!");
} else {
  console.log("It's pleasant.");
}


Explanation:

The if statement checks if the temperature is greater than 30. If true, it prints "It's hot!".
If the first condition is false, the else if checks if the temperature is less than 10. If true, it prints "It's cold!".
If neither of the previous conditions is true, the else block executes, printing "It's pleasant.".
Conditional statements are essential for creating dynamic and responsive programs that can make decisions based on different inputs and conditions.
