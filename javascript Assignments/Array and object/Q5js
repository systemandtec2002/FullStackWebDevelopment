// 5. You are given a JavaScript object representing a student's information. Your task is to use the 'for...in' loop
// to iterate over the properties of the object and perform various operations.

// a. Create a function displayStudentInfo that takes the student object as a parameter. Inside this function, use a
// 'for...in' loop to iterate over the properties of the student object and print each property and its corresponding
// value to the console. The output should look something like this:


const student = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 22,
    major: "Computer Science",
    GPA: 3.8,
    isEnrolled: true
};

function displayStudentInfo(student) {
    for (let property in student) {
        if (student.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
            console.log(`Property: ${property}, Value: ${student[property]}`);
        }
    }
}
displayStudentInfo(student);

/*
Property: name, Value: Alice
Property: age, Value: 22
Property: major, Value: Computer Science
Property: GPA, Value: 3.8
Property: isEnrolled, Value: true
*/
