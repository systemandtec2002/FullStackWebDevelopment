and form controls (<input>,<label>,<textarea>) providind meaning and structure to your content,making
it easier for screen readers and other assistive techonlogies to interpret and preesnt the information.
    2) Add Alt Text to images:
    when including images in your html,always provide  descriptive alternative text using the "alt" attribute(<img alt= "description">).this text is read aloud by screen readers,allowing visually impaired users to understand the content and purpose of the image.
    3)Implement keyboard Navigation:
